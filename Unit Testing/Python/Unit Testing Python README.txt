UT1 - UT4 are the unit test files for python. The other scripts:
	Dummy_Create_WAV_File.py
	Dummy_Merge_JSON.py
	Dummy_Model_Training.py
are duplicates of the files contained in Apache24.

The unit tests must directly call the scripts, since they are scripts without defined functions.

Run Unit_Testing.bat to run the tests.
